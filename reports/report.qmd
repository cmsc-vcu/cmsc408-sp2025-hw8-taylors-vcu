# Problem Background
The goal of this assignment is to pull data from the WDI database and find correlates of human development to reduce the poverty and promote economic development to countries that are in such development.




```{python}
from helpers import create_database_engine, run_sql_and_return_df, run_sql_and_return_html, create_db_wrapper, execute_ddl_from_file, execute_ddl

# Load these variables from .env file.
config_map = {
  'user': "CMSC408_HW8_USER",
  'password': "CMSC408_HW8_PASSWORD",
  'host': "CMSC408_HW8_HOST",
  'database': "CMSC408_HW8_DB_NAME"
}

cnx,config = create_db_wrapper( config_map )
  
```


```{python}
# Do a quick test of the connection and trap the errors better!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  table_schema, table_name, table_rows
from
  information_schema.tables
where
  table_schema in ('world_bank_data')
""")

```

# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Long Name`
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where region is NULL
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country;
""")
```

```{python}
# create table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
create table sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country as 
select * from world_bank_data.wdi_country
where region is NOT NULL;
""")
```

```{python}
# show number of records
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select COUNT(*) as Entries from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country;
""")
```

## Task 5

According to the World Bank, in 2020 there were how many countries in the world?

```{python}
## (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
(select count(*) from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country) - 
(select count(*) from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country where Region is NULL) as Countries;
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select distinct `Region` from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country where
region is NOT NULL;
""")

```

## Task 7

How many countries are in each region?

```{python}
## How many countries are in each region?
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select region , count(*) as `Number of Countries`
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where region is NOT NULL
group by region
order by `Number of Countries`;
""")

```

## Task 8

List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Long Name` as `Country`
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where Region = "North America";
""")

```

## Task 9

```{python}
## The last World Cup soccer tournament was hosted by Qatar.
## What region contains Qatar?  List the region, country short name and full name
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select region, `Short Name`, `Long Name` 
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where `Short Name` = "Qatar";
""")

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Country Code`, `Short Name`,`2-alpha code`,`WB-2 code`,`Region`
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where `2-alpha code` != `WB-2 code`;
""")

```

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Income Group`,COUNT(*)
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
group by `Income Group`;
""")

```

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Country Code`,`Short Name`,Region,`Income Group`
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where `Income Group` is NULL;
""")

```

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""
start transaction;
UPDATE sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
SET `Income Group` = "High income"
where `Income Group` is NULL;

```
```{python}
## Now, display the country again to verify the change stuck!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Country Code`,`Short Name`,Region, `Income Group`
from sp25_taylors_user.wdi_country
where `Country Code` = "VEN";
""")

```

## Task 14

```{python}
## Write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "Region"-"Income Group" pair.  The table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Region` as region,
`Income Group` as income_group,
COUNT(*) as countries

group by `Region`, `Income Group`
order by `Region`, `Income Group`;
""")

```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

GROUP BY `Region`
ORDER BY `Region`;
""")

```

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select 
count(*) as low_income_countries,
`Region` as region,

group by `Region`
Order by low_income_countries desc
limit 1;
""")

```

## Task 17

```{python}
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,
## the country code for the Marshall Islands is MHL.
## (skills: select, where, subquery)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

order by `Short Name`;
""")

```

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins)

## Task 19

```{python}
## Hot enough, yet?  Let's go for ghost-pepper HOT!  Now let's build some
## percentage tables.  For example, across the entire sample, what
## is the percentage of total countries in each income category?
##
## As a first step, build off the result from task 14 and create a table with
## six columns (region, income cat, country count, sum of countries in region,
## sum of countries by income and total sum countries).
##
## THEN, add a 7th column calculating the percent of total for each,
## region-income pair.

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

This particular assignment was quite challenging as the queries that we had to implement were quite complex. 

The skills I felt confident in were using table aliases as well as using `count`, `group by`, and `order by` as these were covered in the previous homework assignment. 

I believe I would need more practice with using subqueries and CASE statements as that was something I never knew existed. 

This assignment somewhat reinforced the SQL competencies for concepts surrounding aggregation and aliases. 

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

The approach to tackling the more complex tasks encompasses figuring out the columns that you would need along with querying GPT to provide an overall to assist with how to obtain the missing pieces. I would then run the query into PHPMyAdmin and view the results and compare that with the output thats being requested in the task and rinse and repeat.


3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

Overall, my biggest takeaway from this assignment would have to be using information schema names, aliases, as well as aggregation to extract the data that we are looking for. 

These skills will definitely be useful in real-world scenarios because I can foresee datasets similar to what we saw in the WDI database.
